Here is a short description of the plugin.  This should be no more than 150 characters.  No markup here.

== Description ==

Git-Syllabus is a tool designed to provide a method for pedagogical materials to be more visibly open-sourced and to allow academics to take advantage of the version control and forking afforded by the GitHub platform. It allows for metadata and centralized repositories to co-exist synchronously with independently-run Wordpress installations. This sort of federation allows for materials to be found, but does not force users to critically rely on a centralized service. This process will ideally facilitate a conversation about open-source pedagogy, and retrofit that style of access and discovery to materials that were developed and published without such elements.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Place the plugin files in a folder called git-syllabus in your installation's plugins folder
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
